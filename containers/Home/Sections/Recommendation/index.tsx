            Iâ€™ve been really impressed in my time working with Erika in her role as one of the leading developers in the Eurosport team.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed font-montserrat">
            I find Erika astute, approachable and engaging - she takes the time and effort to walk through implications and options for decisions we need to make and is a really solid trusted sounding board on technical feasibility and approaches to requirements needs.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed font-montserrat">
            On top of being a really good developer and really hard working, Erika is a joy to work with from a business and stakeholder engagement perspective and I hope to work with her again in the future.
